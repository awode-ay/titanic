Machine learning with Titanic dataset
# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. Using historical data, we have developed and trained a model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features like age, sex, passenger class, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is derived from the famous Titanic dataset, which provides information on the passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic. It contains the following attributes:

- `PassengerId`: An unique index for each passenger.
- `Survived`: Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes).
- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd).
- `Name`: Name of the passenger.
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger.
- `Age`: Age of the passenger.
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard.
- `Ticket`: Ticket number.
- `Fare`: Passenger fare.
- `Cabin`: Cabin number.
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
